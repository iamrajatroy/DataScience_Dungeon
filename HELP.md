# 📜 Adventurer's Guide to Data Science Dungeon

Welcome, weary traveler. You have entered a dungeon constructed of pure data. To survive, you must prove your knowledge.

## 🕹 Controls
| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| **W / Up** | Move Up |
| **A / Left** | Move Left |
| **S / Down** | Move Down |
| **D / Right** | Move Right |
| **SPACE** | Interact / Open Chest / Enter Portal |

## ⚔️ Mechanics
### 1. The Torch (Health)
Your life is tied to your light.
- **Start:** 100% Brightness.
- **Wrong Answer:** -20% Brightness.
- **0% Brightness:** The darkness consumes you. Game Over.
- **Healing:** Answering correctly does *not* heal you. Be careful!

### 2. Chests & Rooms
- Each room contains **3 Chests**.
- You must solve **all 3 chests** to unlock the **Portal**.
- The Portal takes you to the next (harder) room.
- There are **10 Rooms** total.

### 3. Difficulty
- **Brown Chest:** Easy (100 pts)
- **Silver Chest:** Medium (150 pts)
- **Gold Chest:** Hard (200 pts)
- **Room Multiplier:** Points are multiplied by the Room Number (e.g. Room 5 = 5x Points!).

## 💾 Saving
- **Auto-Save:** The game saves after every room and every question.
- **Offline Mode:** If the server goes down, your save is kept safely in your browser. It will sync when you reconnect.

## 💡 Tips
- Read the question carefully before answering. There is no time limit.
- If the screen gets too dark, increase your monitor brightness (cheating, but we won't tell).
- Good luck!
